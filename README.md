# Beamsoft // Website Project Overview

This website project showcases a cutting-edge web experience, leveraging the minimalist and engaging "Linear Style". My goal was to create an intuitive and visually appealing website that not only looks great but also performs excellently across all devices.

## Technologies

This project is built with a stack designed for efficiency, scalability, and a great developer experience:

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without having to leave your HTML.
- **Prismic**: As the headless CMS, Prismic offers a powerful content management system that makes it easy to edit and update content dynamically.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For rich, performant animations that bring the Linear Style to life across the website.

## Features
